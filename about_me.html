									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pro-pic-org.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am a highly skilled and experienced software developer, driven by a passion for programming in Python and Java. Holding a Master's degree in Data Science, I have cultivated a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling, which I have successfully utilized to deliver innovative solutions addressing complex business challenges. My proficiency extends to High-Performance Computing and Infrastructure (HPCI), enhancing my capabilities in optimizing data processing and performance.
									</br></br>
										My journey in the world of software development began at Cognizant, India, where I spent over four years as a Java developer. During this time, I had the privilege of working on diverse frameworks and software, such as Spring Boot, Reactive Spring, Kafka, and GraphQL, enhancing my proficiency in developing efficient, scalable, and high-performance applications.
									</br></br>
										In addition to my technical expertise, I establish a collaborative environment that encourages effective teamwork and ensures on-time project delivery thanks to my in-depth grasp of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and practical experience in agile methodology. My commitment to continuous learning and staying updated on the latest technological advancements empowers me to embrace challenges with enthusiasm and creative problem-solving.
									</br></br>
										I find tremendous fulfillment in exploring the convergence of data science and software development, a synergy that allows me to create data-driven applications and solutions that have a lasting impact. My desire to explore the limitless opportunities at the intersection of these two professions is fueled by my enthusiasm for programming and my solid understanding of data science.
									</br></br>
										I look forward to leveraging my skills and experience to tackle novel challenges and collaborate with diverse teams, ultimately driving transformative innovations in the realm of data science and software engineering. Together, let's embark on a journey of excellence, redefining what technology can achieve.
